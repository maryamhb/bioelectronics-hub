# Overview

Welcome to my bioelectronics project hub. This page outlines current research initiatives, past contributions, and future directions â€” with emphasis on modular design, translational impact, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Projects
- **Capacitive sensing front-ends** for high-resolution biomedical signals
- **Modular ASIC architectures** tailored for low-power, high-precision applications
- **Translational Bioelectronics educational module** development, integrating engineering with clinical relevance
- **Clinical collaboration initiatives** to advance neurocare through bioelectronic support systems

## ðŸ“œ Past Work
- **Mixed-signal designs** in 180nm and 65nm CMOS for sensor interfacing and low-power signal acquisition
- **Active regenerative neural interface (aMNI)** for bidirectional cardiac control and autonomic modulation
- **Epidural electrical stimulation (EES)** research supporting motor recovery and gait restoration in individuals with SCI

## ðŸš€ Future Directions
- **Clinical development of CapSense** for real-time tumour monitoring and adaptive therapeutic feedback
- **Minimally invasive bioelectronic therapy** targeting neuromodulation strategies for Parkinsonâ€™s disease
